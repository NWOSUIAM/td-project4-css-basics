This project is basically my responsive first landing page.
My webpage was structured using HTML whereas it was styles using CSS.
This landing page is actually grouped into five sections.
The first section is about what the webpage entails i.e. about, services, contacts
The Second section is about me- introductory section.
The third section is about what i am into; talking about what motivates me.
The fourth section is about the services that i provide as a developer.
The last section is about how to contact me-physcially and virtually.
